# oibsip_task6
This repository contains a Basic To-Do Web App built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add daily tasks, mark them as completed, and view them in separate "Pending Tasks" and "Completed Tasks" lists. Users can edit or delete tasks, and the app tracks the date and time when tasks are added or completed.
